Oxygen is one of the most substantial elements present on the earth. An adequate amount of it is
required for an enduring life. Without it, life would be over in seconds. Its inadequate supply results in
hypoxia while its complete absence in any part of the body results in anoxia. Both of these conditions are
life-threatening if proper measurements are not taken within time.
For maintaining the oxygen level for diseased persons, cylinders storing oxygen are introduced by
biomedical engineers. These **[oxygen cylinders](https://artemamed.com/categories/oxygen-cylinder)** are
portable; patients can carry them, wherever they go. They may contain liquid or compressed oxygen.
Due to several oxygen-related diseases, the requirements for an ideal oxygen cylinder vary from patient
to patient. And it is a very difficult task to find the ideal one.
Here we will find the ideal oxygen cylinder by evaluating the types of oxygen cylinders available in the
market and the types of oxygen deficiency diseases.

## Oxygen deficiency disease types:

Firstly, we will discuss some of the diseases related to the respiratory system:

- **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** COPD is a group of lung diseases. The use of an
  **[oxygen cylinder](https://artemamed.com/products/oxygen-cylinder)** can help improve oxygen levels and
  overcome symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.
- **Pneumonia:** It is an infection that causes inflammation in the air sacs in one or both lungs, filling
  them with fluid or pus. Oxygen cylinders are required by these patients for the maintenance of the
  respiratory system until the disease disappears.
- **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS):** ARDS is a critical lung condition that causes
  impairment of oxygen exchange. They need oxygen cylinders 24/7 hours to support their respiratory
  system.
- **Cystic Fibrosis:** Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that causes mucus to be filled in the airways.
  They may require oxygen cylinders.
- **Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD):** ILD is a type of lung disorder which causes inflammation of the lung
  tissue. They require oxygen cylinders to overcome shortness of breath.
- **Severe Asthma:** Asthma attacks result in decreased oxygen levels due to the narrowing of the
  airways. Oxygen cylinders are required by the patients to use them, in case of an attack.
- **Chronic Hypoxemia:** When oxygen level decreases to a severe level it results in hypoxemia. Such
  patients require oxygen therapy for a long time.

## Oxygen cylinder tank sizes:

Oxygen cylinders are manufactured in the market differing in design, size, and quality. The most
important factor in finding the most compatible cylinder for oneself is to know about the sizes of the
cylinders.
The size of an **[oxygen cylinder](https://artemamed.com/products/oxygen-cylinder)** refers to its length
and width indicating the capacity of oxygen in it. Some of the most common symbols used for oxygen
cylinder sizes are:

- **Type A:** It is the smallest size of oxygen cylinder available. It contains about 240 liters of oxygen. It
  is carriable and transportable. Patients personally use it and always keep it to themselves.
- **Type B:** It is slightly larger than type A. It can store 680 liters of oxygen. It is also easy to carry. It is
  also used by the patients personally at their homes.
- **Type D:** It is the most common medium-sized cylinder. It stores about 1700 liters of oxygen. It can
  be used personally and in hospitals.
- **Type E:** It is a tank of larger size. It stores about 6800 liters of oxygen. It is used in hospitals and
  clinics to provide oxygen to more than 1 patient at a time.
- **Type M/H/K:** All of these three types are of the largest size. They differ slightly in height, width,
  and capacity. They are used in hospitals for multiple patients and for a continuous supply of oxygen.

## How to choose the ideal one?

It depends upon various factors as above we have discussed the types of respiratory disorders and the
sizes of **[oxygen cylinders](https://artemamed.com/products/oxygen-cylinder)** available now. Each size
deals with a specific disease, let's see how:

- **Type A and B cylinders:** Being small in size and light in weight can be used for any kind of
  respiratory problem for a normal flow of oxygen The main difference is they can be carried everywhere
  by the patients. It also includes diseases like, sleep apnea, asthma, and heart failure.
- **Type D:** With more oxygen capacity can also be carried anywhere by the patients but is used for
  more severe cases where a high quantity of oxygen is demanded such as Congestive Heart Failure (CHF),
  Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
- **Type E, M, and others:** Are large, used for a continuous supply of oxygen but especially in hospitals
  and healthcare, and are usually not carried by patients.

## Conclusion:

In a nutshell, one should completely know about the severity of their disorder and the sizes of **[oxygen
cylinders](https://artemamed.com/products/oxygen-cylinder)** available in the market before purchasing it.
The quality and company can be of your own choice depending upon affordability but you must have to
consult with your doctor for a completely reliable treatment.
